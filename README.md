Day 1 
#java script is synchronus and single threaded language.
#everything in javascript happens in execution context.
#there are two components in execution context one is Mermory and other is code component.
#in javascript every code is handled in call stack. It has Global execution context at bottom and it calls new context every time and after execution delete that context.
#variables are data containers.
#There are three variables let,var and const.
#var- variables can be deleared and upadted .A global scope.
#let-variables can not  be re-delcleared but can be updated.Block scope
#const- variables can not be re-declared and updated.Block scope.

#primitive and non-primitive data types , and objects.
#objects are datatypes with different key value pairs and can be accessed by , object_name.key_name e.g if student {
    full_name ="mahesh chothve";
    Roll_no =30;
    age=28;     
} we can access name by console.log(student.full_name)

//Loops : are used to execute same piece of code again and again.
there are for , do-while , while loops in JS.

//for-in - Loops are used for objects,arrays e.g. for(let val in product){ }

//for-of - Loops are used for String to iterate each character
 e.g. let Str="mahesh"
 for(let c of Str){ 
    console.log(c)
 } so it will give us each character from String.
